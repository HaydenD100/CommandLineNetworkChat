This C++ project uses netcat nv and nvp function too setup a chat between users. A user can decide if they would like too open a chat or join an existing chat. If a user wants to open a chat they can decide what port they want it to be on. If a user wants too join a chat they have to input the ip and port of someone who has opened a chat.

Too run this file you need to have netcat installed and needs too be running on windows, if its on linux you have to change  ncat too nc on both OpenCommand and ConnectCommand.
